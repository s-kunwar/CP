## Hey there! 👋

I'm a Computer Science undergrad who loves solving problems, breaking code (intentionally), and fixing it faster than it broke. 😎

- ⚔️ Competitive Programming Enthusiast – always ready for a brain battle!
- ⚡ Known as the **Error Exorcist** – if there's a bug, I banish it.
- 🌍 Passionate **Open Source Contributor** – I believe in building together.
- 💻 Currently sharpening my skills in **data stuctures and algorithm**.
